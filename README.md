# Memory Efficient Doubly Linked List Python Implementation
## XOR Linked List
XOR Linked List is the memory efficient version of Doubly Linked List because it makes use of only one space for address field with every node.
### Functions used in this Doubly Linked List are as follows.
* InsertAtStart(value)
* InsertAtEnd(value)
* DeleteAtStart()
* DeleteAtEnd()
* Print()
* ReversePrint()
* Length()
* PrintByIndex(index)
* isEmpty()

Private Comment which is only used for type cast id of an object of node into object.
* __type_cast(id)

#### Class which has to be initialized:
XorLinkedList()
#### InsertAtStart(value):
It takes one argument which is value and insert it at the start/begining of the list.
#### InsertAtEnd(value):
It takes one argument which is value and insert it at the ending of the list.
#### DeleteAtStart():
It will delete first element of the list and return it.
#### DeleteAtEnd():
It will delete last element of the list and return it.
#### Print():
It will print all elements of the list.
#### ReversePrint():
It will print all elements of the list in reverse order(Backward Traversing).
#### Length():
It returns the length of the list.
#### PrintByIndex(index):
It returns the value of list at required index, if value is not present it returns the error.
#### isEmpty():
It returns True if list is empty otherwise false.
#### __type_cast(id):
It only type cast id of an object of node into object and returns the object.
